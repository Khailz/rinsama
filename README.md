 Reuploaded Rinsama
 
 This repo is obsolete as I do not use Teamspeak anymore. Though I do update sometimes when there is interest in use for running teamspeak servers.

Small mistake in the last repo for this concerning security.


There are currently two folders missing that provide most of the fun functions. Once I get the backup I will reupload so Rinsama is functional.
